## Notes

*Credit to cocktaildb.com for the drink data backing up the site*
* If you fire up the app, you'll notice the database has some data issues. It's definitely not production-ready and many of the drinks are missing ingredients. This wasn't of concern for me since this project was mainly for learning Django - not building a final product.
